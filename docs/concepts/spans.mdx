title: "Spans"
---

A span is a single model call. A span is part of a trace. You can create a span using `start_span`. For example,

```python
with tatara.start_span(event="generate_visual_description"):
    prompt = "Generate a visual description of a dog"
        response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            model=model_name,
            temperature=temperature,
            frequency_penalty=freq_penalty,
            max_tokens=max_tokens,
        )
```

Once the span has started, you can use it to log the LLM output

```python

tatara.current_span().log_llm_success(prompt=character_description, output=ret,
                params=LLMParams(
                model=model_name,
                temperature=temperature,
                frequency_penalty=freq_penalty,
                max_tokens=max_tokens,
                provider=ProviderEnum.OPENAI,
            ),
            usage_metrics=LLMUsageMetrics.from_oai_completion_usage(
                response.usage
            ))
```

If you want to keep track of the parent of the span, you can pass the parent span as an argument

```python
with tatara.start_span(event="generate_image", parent_event="generate_visual_description"):

```

A parent call in this case, is a model call that your call depends on. For example, your diffusion model might depend on an LLM call.
In this case, the LLM call's span would be the parent of the diffusion call's span

```python
{
    "prompt": "Generate a visual description of a dog",
    "response": "A dog is a domesticated carnivore of the family Canidae. It is part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore."
}
```

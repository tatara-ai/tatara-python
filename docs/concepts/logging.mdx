# Traces

A trace is a collection of model calls that belong together. You can create a trace with

```python
with tatara.start_trace(event=trace_name, id_=<your_trace_id>, user_id=<you_user_id>):
    # do stuff
```

# Spans

A span is a single model call. A span is part of a trace. You can create a span using `start_span`. For example,

```python
   with tatara.start_span(event="generate_visual_description"):
   prompt = "Generate a visual description of a dog"
    response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        model=model_name,
        temperature=temperature,
        frequency_penalty=freq_penalty,
        max_tokens=max_tokens,
    )
```

If you want to keep track of the parent of the span, you can pass the parent span as an argument

```python
   with tatara.start_span(event="generate_image", parent_event="generate_visual_description"):

```

A parent call in this case, is a model call that your call depends on. For example, your diffusion model might depend on an LLM call.
In this case, the LLM call's span would be the parent of the diffusion call's span

# Datasets

A dataset is a collection of records. You can create a dataset with

```python
from tatara.dataset import Dataset, init_dataset, get_dataset
my_test_dataset = init_dataset("my_test_dataset")
```

This dataset is empty, so we'll add some records to it.

```python
new_records = [
{
        "input":"my test input for record 1",
        "output":"my test output for record 1"
},
{
        "input":"my test input for record 2",
        "output":"my test output for record 2",
}
]

ds.insert(new_records)
```

Now all of this data has been saved to Tatara, so you can view it in the UI by going to <>.

You can also get a dataset by its name in a new session.

```python
my_test_dataset = get_dataset("my_test_dataset")
```

```python
{
    "prompt": "Generate a visual description of a dog",
    "response": "A dog is a domesticated carnivore of the family Canidae. It is part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore."
}
```

# Evals

An eval is a function that takes in a dataset, which contains a model's outputs, and a function to evaluate that dataset. The eval gives you a score for the model's outputs.
The score can be an int, float, bool, or categorical value (string). All evals must subclass [Eval](https://github.com/tatara-ai/tatara-python/blob/main/tatara/evals/eval.py#L19).

# Datasets

A dataset is a collection of records.

## Record

A record is a single data point in a dataset. Is it _either_ a Span or custom input and output you've curated yourself.

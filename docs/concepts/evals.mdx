title: "Evals"
---

An eval is a function that takes in a dataset, which contains a model's outputs, and a function to evaluate that dataset. The eval gives you a score for the model's outputs.
The score can be an int, float, bool, or categorical value (string). All evals must subclass [Eval](https://github.com/tatara-ai/tatara-python/blob/main/tatara/evals/eval.py#L19).

A dataset is a collection of records. You can create a dataset with

```python
from tatara import Dataset, init_dataset, get_dataset
from tatara import tatara
tatara.init(project=<my_project>)
my_test_dataset = init_dataset("my_test_dataset")
```

This dataset is empty, so we'll add some records to it.

```python
new_records = [
{
        "input":"my test input for record 1",
        "output":"my test output for record 1"
},
{
        "input":"my test input for record 2",
        "output":"my test output for record 2",
}
]

ds.insert(new_records)
```

Now all of this data has been saved to Tatara, so you can view it in the UI by going to the [Datasets tab](https://app.tatara.ai/datasets) and selecting "my_test_dataset".

You can also get a dataset by its name in a new session.

```python
my_test_dataset = get_dataset("my_test_dataset")
```

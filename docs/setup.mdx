### Prerequisites

## Step 1: Install Tatara
Tatara captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

Install our Python SDK using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

```bash
pip install tatara
```

<Tip>
  {" "}
  If you're using a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file to manage your project's
  dependencies, we recommend specifying the client version. You can view the current
  Python client version over at [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/tatara/).{" "}
</Tip>

## Step 2: Setting up your API key

<Info>
  Tatara is currently in closed beta. If you want an API key, request one by e-mailing us at
  [support@tatara.ai](mailto:support@tatara.ai) with your use case.
</Info>

Once you have your API key, you'll need to set it as an environment variable. This allows your application to securely authenticate with Tatara's services. Use the following command in your terminal, replacing `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with the API key:

```bash
export TATARA_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

You can also pass it directly via the SDK when initializing.

```python
import tatara

tatara.init(project="awesome_project", api_key=<YOUR_API_KEY>)
```

<Check> You're now all set to start using Tatara! </Check>
